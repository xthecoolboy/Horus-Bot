# Horus Bot #### Under construction  👨‍💻
A chat bot for Discord app based off <a href="https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/">discord.js</a>. </br>
This repository consists of a personal project to develop a BOT in Discord, as a way of learning.
Yes, it's the default tumblr avatar. But it's so cute! 🥺
</br>
</br>
Some files and code snippets have been removed to maintain the integrity and security of the project.

# Installation

This bot is written to run on top of node.js. Please see https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have NodeJS installed, running `npm install` from the bot directory should install all required packages. If this command prints errors, the bot won't work!


After installing all dependencies, open your terminal and type `node .` to run the bot project.
</br>
<br>
Remember to create your application at <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications">Discord/developer</a>, taking your bot's Token and adding it to `bot.login(yourToken);`

After doing this, open the terminal and type:
```
npm start
```
The nodemon will be started and, for each Save data, the bot will be restarted with the new changes made.

If the nodemon fails to run or gives an error, the dependencies have not been installed correctly.

# Help

The official bot server on Discord will be available as soon as the initial development is complete.

## Usage

Create an .env file with no name, i.e  `.env` and fill out the values:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=
DISCORD_PREFIX=
```
